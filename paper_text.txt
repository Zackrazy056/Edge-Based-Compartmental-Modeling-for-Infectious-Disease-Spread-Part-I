Edge-Based Compartmental Modeling for Infectious Disease Spread
Part I: An Overview

Abstract
The primary tool for predicting infectious disease spread and intervention eﬀectiveness is the mass
action Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model of Kermack and McKendrick [24]. Its usefulness derives
largely from its conceptual and mathematical simplicity; however, it incorrectly assumes all individuals
have the same contact rate and contacts are ﬂeeting. This paper is the ﬁrst of three investigating
edge-based compartmental modeling, a technique eliminating these assumptions. In this paper, we derive
simple ordinary diﬀerential equation models capturing social heterogeneity (heterogeneous contact rates)
while explicitly considering the impact of contact duration. We introduce a graphical interpretation
allowing for easy derivation and communication of the model. This paper focuses on the technique and
how to apply it in diﬀerent contexts. The companion papers investigate choosing the appropriate level
of complexity for a model and how to apply edge-based compartmental modeling to populations with
various sub-structures.
1 Introduction
The conceptual and mathematical simplicity of Kermack and McKendrick’s [24, 1] Mass Action Susceptible-
Infected-Recovered (SIR) model has made it the most popular quantitative tool to study infectious disease
spread for over 80 years. However, it ignores important details of the fabric of social interactions, assuming
homogeneous contact rates and negligible contact duration. Improvements are largely ad hoc. spanning the
range between mild modiﬁcations of the model and elaborate agent-based simulations [1, 28, 25, 49, 15, 17].
Increased complexity allows us to incorporate more realistic eﬀects, but at a price. It becomes diﬃcult to
identify which variables drive disease spread or to address sensitivity to changing the underlying assumptions.
In this paper we show that shifting our attention to the status of an average contact rather than an average
individual yields a surprisingly simple mathematical description, expanding the universe of analytically
tractable models. This allows epidemiologists to consider more realistic social interactions and test sensitivity
to assumptions, improving the robustness of public health recommendations.
We motivate our approach using the standard Mass Action (MA) SIR model. We are interested in the
susceptible S(t), infected I(t), and recovered R(t) proportions of the population as time t changes. Under
mass action assumptions, an infected individual causes new infections at rate ˆβS(t), where ˆβ is the per-
infected transmission rate and S is the probability the recipient is susceptible. Recovery to an immune
state happens at rate γ. The ﬂux of individuals from susceptible to infected to recovered is represented
by a ﬂow diagram (ﬁgure 1) making the model conceptually simple. This leads to a simple mathematical
interpretation, the low-dimensional, ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) system
˙S =− ˆβIS , ˙I = ˆβIS− γI , ˙R = γI .

MA model. Each compartment accumulates and loses probability at the rates given on the arrows.
The dot denotes diﬀerentiation in time. An ODE system allows for easy prediction of details such as early
growth rates, ﬁnal size, and intermediate dynamics. Using S + I + R = 1 we reexpress this as
˙S =− ˆβIS , I = 1− S− R , ˙R = γI , (1)
The product IS measures the proportion of contacts that are from an infected individual to a susceptible
individual.
The MA model often provides a reasonable description of epidemics; however it has well-recognized ﬂaws
which cause the frequency of infected to susceptible contacts to vary from IS. We highlight two. It neglects
both social heterogeneity, variation in contact rates which can be quite broad [26, 41], and contact duration,
implicitly assuming all contacts are inﬁnitesimally short. Because of these omissions, model predictions can
diﬀer from reality. For example, due to social heterogeneity, early infections tend to have more contacts [8]
and when infected may cause more infections than “average” individuals, enhancing the early spread over
that predicted by the MA model [2, 42, 32, 23, 31]. When contact duration is signiﬁcant, an infected
individual may have already infected its neighbors, reducing its ability to cause new infections. Because of
these assumptions, the MA model predicts the same results for a sexually transmitted disease in a completely
monogamous population, a population with serial monogamy, and a population with wide variation in contact
levels with mean one. Intuitively we expect these to produce dramatically diﬀerent epidemics, but no existing
mathematical theory allows analytic comparisons.
Over the past 25 years, attempts have been made to eliminate these assumptions without sacriﬁcing
analytical tractability. With few exceptions (notably [54]) these make an “all-or-nothing” assumption about
contact duration: contacts are ﬂeeting and never repeated or they never change. With ﬂeeting contacts,
social heterogeneity is introduced by adding multiple risk groups to the MA model: in extreme cases there
are arbitrarily many subgroups (the Mean Field Social Heterogeneity model) [1, 29, 30, 40, 48]. This model
is relatively well understood and can be rigorously reduced to a handful of equations. With permanent
contacts, social heterogeneity is indroduced through static networks [10, 4, 42, 23, 32]. Static network
results typically give the ﬁnal size but no dynamic information. Some attempts to predict dynamics with
static networks use Pair Approximation techniques [14] relying on approximation of network structures. More
rigorous approaches avoid these approximations, but are more diﬃcult [53, 27, 5, 46]. Of these, only [53]
yields a closed ODE system, (see also [35, 20]). This model lacks an illustration like ﬁgure 1, hampering
communication and further of development. Finite, nonzero contact duration is typically handled through
simulation, which is usually too slow to study parameter space.
Although no coherent mathematical structure to study social heterogeneity and contact duration exists,
there have been studies collecting this data in real-world contexts [41, 56, 50, 8]. Typically the resulting
measurements have been reduced to average contact rates to make the mathematics tractable. Much of
the available and potentially relevant detail is discarded because existing models cannot capture the detail
collected.
We ﬁnd that the appropriate perspective allows us to develop conceptually and mathematically simple
models that incorporate social heterogeneity and (arbitrary) contact duration. This provides a unifying
framework for existing models and allows an expanded universe of models. Our goal in each case is to
calculate the susceptible, infected, or recovered proportions of the population, but we ﬁnd that this can
be answered more easily using an equivalent problem. We ask the question, “what is the probability that
a randomly chosen test node u is susceptible, infected, or recovered?” Because u is chosen randomly, the
probability it is susceptible equals the proportion susceptible S(t), and similarly for I and R. If we know
S(t), then the initial conditions and ˙R = γI, I = 1− S− R determine I(t) and R(t) as in (1).

The probability u is susceptible is the probability no neighbor has ever transmitted infection to u. The
method to calculate this is the focus of this paper. This probability depends on how many neighbors u
has, the rate its neighbors change, and the probability that a random neighbor is infected at any given time.
Because a random neighbor is likely to have more contacts than a random node, knowing the infected fraction
of the population does not give the probability a neighbor of u is infected. We focus on the probability a
random neighbor is infected rather than the probability a random individual is infected. Once we calculate
this, it is straightforward to calculate the probabilityu is susceptible. The resulting edge-based compartmental
modeling approach signiﬁcantly increases the eﬀects we can study compared to MA models with only a small
complexity penalty.
In this paper we consider the spread of epidemics in two general classes of networks,actual degree networks
(based on Conﬁguration Model networks [39, 45, 19]) and expected degree networks (based on Mixed Poisson
[commonly called Chung-Lu] networks [9, 47, 6]). In both cases we can consider static and dynamic networks.
In actual degree networks, a node is assigned k stubs where k is a random non-negative integer assigned
independently for each node from some probability distribution. Edges are created by pairing stubs from
diﬀerent nodes. In expected degree networks, a node is assigned κ where κ is a random non-negative real
number. Edges are assigned between two nodes u and v with probability proportional to κuκv. We develop
exact diﬀerential equations for the large population limit, which we compare with simulations. Detailed
descriptions of the simulation techniques are in the Appendix.
We summarize the populations we consider in Table 1. We begin by analyzing the simplest edge-based
compartmental model in detail, exploring epidemic spread in a static network of known degree distribution,
a Conﬁguration Model network. To derive the equations, we introduce a ﬂow diagram that leads to a simple
mathematical formulation. We next consider disease spreading through dynamic actual degree networks and
then static and dynamic expected degree networks. The template shown here allows us to derive a handful
of ODEs for each of these populations. Unsurprisingly, the stronger our assumptions, the simpler our formu-
lation becomes. We neglect heterogeneity within the population other than the contact levels, assume the
disease has a very simple structure, and assume the population is at equilibrium prior to disease introduction.
The companion papers investigate conditions under which the simpler models are appropriate [38] and how
to apply the technique to more complex population and disease structures [37].
2 Conﬁguration Model Epidemics
We demonstrate our approach with Conﬁguration Model (CM) networks. A CM network is static with a
known degree distribution (the distribution of the number of contacts). We create a CM network with N
nodes as follows: We assign each node u its degree ku with probability P (ku) and give it ku stubs (half-

Figure 2: Edge-based compartmental modeling for Conﬁguration Model networks. The ﬂow diagram for a static
CM network. (Left) The φS, φI, and φR compartments represent the probability that a neighbor is susceptible, infected, or
recovered and has not transmitted infection. The 1 − θ compartment is the probability it has transmitted. The ﬂuxes between
the φ compartments result from infection or recovery of a neighbor of the test node and the φI to 1− θ ﬂux results from a
neighbor transmitting infection to the test node. (Right) S, I, and R represent the proportion of the population susceptible,
infected, and recovered. We can ﬁnd S explicitly, and I and R follow as in the MA model.
edges). Once all nodes are assigned stubs, we pair stubs randomly into edges. The probability a randomly
selected node u has degree k is P (k). In contrast, the probability a stub of u connects to some stub of v is
proportional to kv. So the probability a randomly selected neighbor of u has degree k is
Pn(k) = kP (k)/⟨K⟩
See [16, 31] for more detail.
We assume the disease transmits from an infected node to a neighbor at rate β. If the neighbor is
susceptible, it becomes infected. Infected nodes recover at rate γ. Throughout, we assume a large population,
small initial proportion infected, the small initial proportion of stubs belonging to infected nodes, and growing
outbreak. Our equations become correct once the number of infections N I has grown large enough to behave
deterministically, while the proportion infected I is still small. While stochastic eﬀects are important, other
methods such as branching process approximations [12] (which apply in large populations with small numbers
infected) maybe more useful.
To calculate S(t), I(t), and R(t) we note that these are the probabilities a random test node u is in each
state. We calculate S(t) by noting it is also the probability none of u’s neighbors has yet transmitted to u.
We would like to treat each neighbor as independent, but the probability one neighbor v has become infected
is aﬀected by whether another neighbor w of u has transmitted to u since u could infect v. Accounting for
this directly requires considerable bookkeeping. A simpler approach removes the correlation by assuming
u causes no infections. This does not alter the state of u: the probabilities we calculate for u will be the
proportion of the population in each state under the original assumption u behaves as any other node, and
so this yields an equivalent problem. Further discussion of this modiﬁcation is in the Appendix.
We deﬁne θ(t) to be the probability a randomly chosen neighbor has not transmitted to u. Initially θ is
close to 1. For large CM networks, neighbors of u are independent. So given its degree k, u is susceptible at
time t with probability s(k, θ(t)) = θ(t)k. Thus S(t) = ∑
k P (k)s(k, θ(t)) = ψ(θ(t)) where
ψ(x) =
∑
k
P (k)xk
is the probability generating function [58] of the degree distribution [the properties of ψ we use are that
its derivative is ∑
k kP (k)xk−1, its second derivative is ∑
k k(k− 1)P (k)xk−2, and ψ′(1) =⟨K⟩]. For many
important probability distributions, ψ takes a simple form, which simpliﬁes our examples. Combining with
the ﬂow diagram for S, I, and R in ﬁgure 2, we have
˙R = γI , S = ψ(θ) , I = 1− S− R
To calculate the new variable θ, we break it into three parts; the probability a neighbor v is susceptible
at time t, φS; the probability v is infected at time t but has not transmitted infection to u, φI; and the
4
===== PAGE 5 =====
probability v has recovered by time t but did not transmit infection to u, φR. Then θ = φS + φI + φR.
Initially φS and θ are approximately 1 and φI, φR are small (they sum to θ− φS). The ﬂow diagram for φS,
φI, φR, and 1− θ (ﬁgure 2) shows the probability ﬂuxes between these compartments. The rate an infected
neighbor transmits to u is β so the φI to 1− θ ﬂux is βφI. We conclude ˙θ =−βφI. To ﬁnd φI we will use
φI = θ− φS− φR and calculate φS and φR explicitly.
The rate an infected neighbor recovers is γ. Thus the φI to φR ﬂux is γφI. This is proportional to the
ﬂux into 1− θ with the constant of proportionality γ/β. That is, ˙φR = γφI, d
dt(1− θ) = βφI. Since φR
and 1− θ both begin as approximately 0, we have φR = γ(1− θ)/β in the large population limit. To ﬁnd
φS, recall a neighbor v has degree k with probability Pn(k) = kP (k)/⟨K⟩. Given k, v is susceptible with
probability θk−1 (we disallow transmission from u so k−1 nodes can infect v). A weighted average gives φS =∑
k Pn(k)θk−1 = ∑
k kP (k)θk−1/⟨K⟩ = ψ′(θ)/ψ′(1). Thus φI = θ− φS− φR = θ− ψ′(θ)/ψ′(1)− γ(1− θ)/β
and ˙θ =−βφI becomes
˙θ =−βθ + β ψ′(θ)
ψ′(1) + γ(1− θ)
yielding
˙θ =−βθ + β ψ′(θ)
ψ′(1) + γ(1− θ) , (2)
˙R = γI , S = ψ(θ) , I = 1− S− R . (3)
This captures substantially more population structure than the MA model with only marginally more com-
plexity. This is the system of [35] and is equivalent to that of [53]. It improves on approaches of [5, 27]
which require eitherO(M) orO(M2) ODEs where M is the (possibly unbounded) maximum degree. This
derivation is simpler than [53] because we choose variables with a conservation property, simplifying the
bookkeeping.
The edge-based compartmental modeling approach we have introduced forms the basis of our paper.
Depending on the network structure, some details will change. However, we will remain as consistent as
possible.
2.1 R0 and ﬁnal size
One of the most important parameters for an infectious disease is its basic reproductive number R0, the
average number of infections caused by a node infected early in an epidemic. When R0 < 1 epidemics are
impossible, while when R0 > 1 they are possible, though not guaranteed. For this model, we ﬁnd that R0
is (see Appendix)
R0 = β

for θ(∞). IfR0 > 1 this has two solutions, the larger of which isθ = 1 (the pre-disease equilibrium). We want
the smaller solution. The total fraction of the population infected in the course of an epidemic is R(∞) =
1−ψ(θ(∞)). These calculations ofR0 and R(∞) are in agreement with previous observations [32, 42, 2, 3, 51].
WhenR0 < 1, our approach breaks down: full details are in the Appendix.

degree distibution is Poisson with mean 5, half the nodes have degree 2 and the other half degree 8, and
ﬁnally a truncated powerlaw distribution in which P (k)∝ k−νe−k/40 where ν = 1 .418. We see that the
degree distribution signiﬁcantly alters the spread, with increased heterogeneity leading to an earlier peak,
but generally a smaller epidemic. Our predictions ﬁt, while the MA model using ˆβ = β⟨K⟩ fails.
3 Actual Degree Models
For the CM networks, each node has a speciﬁc number of stubs. Edges are created by pairing stubs, and
no changes are allowed. In generalizing to other “actual degree” models, we assign each node a number of
stubs, but allow edges to break and the freed stubs to create new edges. We consider three limits: In the
ﬁrst, the Mean Field Social Heterogeneity model, at every moment a stub is connected to a new neighbor.
In the second, the Dynamic Fixed-Degree model, edges last for some time before breaking. When an edge
breaks, the stubs immediately form new edges with stubs from other edges that have just broken. In the
third, the Dormant Contact model, we assume edges break as in the Dynamic Fixed-Degree model, but stubs
wait before ﬁnding new neighbors.
3.1 Mean Field Social Heterogeneity
We analyze the Mean Field Social Heterogeniety (MFSH) model similarly. We take θ as the probability a
stub has never transmitted infection to the test node u from any neighbor. To deﬁne φS, φI, and φR we
require that the stub has not transmitted infection to u and additionally the current neighbor is susceptible,
infected, or recovered. Since at each moment an individual chooses a new neighbor, the probability of
connecting to a node of a given status is the proportion of all stubs belonging to nodes of that status. We
must track the proportion of stubs that belong to susceptible, infected, or recovered nodes πS, πI, and πR.
Because of the rapid turnover of neighbors, we ﬁnd that φS is the product of the probability that a stub
has not transmitted θ with the probability it has just joined with a susceptible neighbor πS so φS = θπS.
Similarly φI = θπI and φR = θπR.
We create ﬂow diagrams as before. The S, I, and R diagram is unchanged, but the diagram for the φ
variables and 1− θ changes. There are no φS to φI or φI to φR ﬂuxes because of the explicit assumption
that the neighbors at any two times are independent. The change in neighbor status is due to change of
neighbor. The ﬂux into 1 − θ from φI is βφI as before. We need a new ﬂow diagram for πs, πI, and πR
similar to that for S, I, and R. Stubs belonging to infected nodes become stubs belonging to recovered nodes
at rate γ, thus ˙πR = γπI. We calculate πS explicitly: the probability a stub belongs to a node of degree k

Because contacts are durationless, neighbors do not change status while joined to an individual, so there is no ﬂux between the
φ variables (left). The new variables πS, πI, and πR (bottom right) represent the probability that a randomly selected stub
belongs to a susceptible, infected, or recovered node. We can ﬁnd πS in terms of θ and then solve for πI and πR in much the
same way we solve for I and R in the CM model. We then ﬁnd each φ variable is θ times the corresponding π variable.
is kP (k)/⟨K⟩, and the probability the node is susceptible is θk. Taking the weighted average of this we ﬁnd
πS = θψ′(θ)/ψ′(1). Finally, πI = 1− πS− πR.
Combining these observations ˙πR = γπI = γφI /θ =−(γ/β) ˙θ/θ. So πR =−(γ/β) lnθ (the constant of
integration is 0). We have πI = 1− πS− πR = 1− θψ′(θ)/ψ′(1) + (γ/β) lnθ and ˙θ =−βθπ I. Thus
˙θ =−βθ + β θ2ψ′(θ)

The MFSH model has been considered previously [1, 29, 30, 40, 48], with the population stratiﬁed by
degree. Setting ζ to be the proportion of all stubs which belong to infected nodes (equivalent to πI above),
the pre-existing system is
˙Sk =−βkS kζ
˙Ik = βkS kζ− γIk
ζ =
∑

where Sk and Ik are the probabilities a random individual with k contacts is susceptible or recovered. A
known change of variables reduces this to a few equations equivalent to ours (see Appendix).

3.1.2 Example
We take a population with degrees 1, 5, and 25. The proportions are chosen such that an equal number of
stubs belong to each class: P (1) = 25/31, P (5) = 5/31, and P (25) = 1/31. Thus
ψ(x) = 25x + 5x5 + x25
31
We set β = γ = 1 and compare a simulation in a population of 5 × 105 with theory in ﬁgure 5.
3.2 Dynamic Fixed-Degree
The Dynamic Fixed-Degree (DFD) model interpolates between the CM and MFSH models. We assign
each node’s degree k as before and pair stubs randomly. As time progresses, edges break. The freed stubs
immediately join with stubs from other edges that break, a process we refer to as “edge swapping”. The
rate an edge breaks is η.
We develop ﬂow diagrams (ﬁgure 6) as before. The S, I, and R diagram is unchanged. We again track
the probabilities πS, πI, and πR that a random stub belongs to a susceptible, infected, or recovered node.
The diagram is unchanged. The diagram for θ and the φ variables changes: We have ﬂuxes from φS to φI
and φI to φR representing infection or recovery of the neighbor as in the CM model, but we also have ﬂuxes
from φS to φS, φI, or φR resulting from edge swapping. We have similar edge swapping ﬂuxes from φI and
φR. The ﬂux into φS from edge swapping is ηθπS. The ﬂux out of φS from edge swapping is ηφS. Similar
results hold for φI and φR.
Our earlier techniques to ﬁnd φI break down. We solve for φS and φI using ODEs. To complete the
system, we need the φS to φI ﬂux. Consider a neighbor v of our test node u such that: the stub belonging
to u never transmitted to u and the stub belonging to v never transmitted to v prior to the u-v edge forming
Given this, the probability v is susceptible is q = ∑
k kP (k)θk−1/⟨K⟩ = ψ′(θ)/ψ′(1). Thus, given that v is
susceptible, v becomes infected at rate

q =−
˙θψ′′(θ)/ψ′(1)
ψ′(θ)/ψ′(1) = βφI

Thus the φS to φI ﬂux is the product of φS, the probability a stub has not transmitted infection to the test
node and connects to a susceptible node, with βφI ψ′′(θ)/ψ′(θ), the rate the node becomes infected given
that the stub has not transmitted and connects to a susceptible node. This completes ﬁgure 6.

Figure 7: Dynamic Fixed-Degree Example (section 3.2.2). Model predictions (dashed) match the average of 102
simulated epidemics (solid) in a population of 10 4 nodes. For each simulation, time is chosen so that t = 0 corresponds to 3%
cumulative incidence. Then they are averaged to give the solid curve.
We take β = 5/4, γ = 1, and η = 1/2. The equations accurately predict the spread (ﬁgure 7).
Our simulations are slower because we must track edges, so we have used smaller population sizes. To
reduce noise, we perform 250 simulations, averaging the 102 that become epidemics.
3.3 Dormant Contacts
We ﬁnally generalize the DFD model, allowing stubs to enter a dormant phase after edges break. This
Dormant Contact (DC) model is appropriate for serial monogamy where individuals do not immediately ﬁnd
a new partner. It is the most general model we present: it reduces to any model of this paper in appropriate
limits [38].
A node is assigned km stubs using the probability mass function P (km). We take ψ(x) = ∑
km P (km)xkm.
A stub is dormant or active depending on whether it is currently connected to a neighbor. The maximum
degree of a node is km and the “active” and “dormant” degrees are ka and kd respectively, ka + kd = km. In
addition to φS, φI, and φR we add φD denoting the probability a stub is dormant and has never transmitted
infection from a neighbor, so θ = φS + φI + φR + φD. Active stubs become dormant at rate η2 and dormant
stubs become active at rate η1.
We now develop ﬂow diagrams (ﬁgure 8). The diagram for S, I, and R is as before. The diagram for θ
and the φ variables is similar to the DFD model, but with the new compartment φD. The ﬂuxes associated
with edge breaking are at rate η2 times φS, φI, or φR and go from the appropriate compartment into φD,
for a total of η2(θ− φD). To describe ﬂuxes due to edge creation, we generalize the deﬁnitions of πS, πI,
and πR to give the probability a stub is dormant (and thus available to form a new contact) and belongs to
a susceptible, infected, or recovered node, with π = πS + πI + πR the probability a stub is dormant. The
probability a new neighbor is susceptible, infected, or recovered is πS/π, πI /π, and πR/π respectively. The
ﬂuxes associated with edge creation occur at total rate η1φD, with proportions πS/π, πI /π, and πR/π into
φS, φI, and φR respectively.
The ﬂow diagram for the π variables is related to that for the DFD model, but we must account for
active and dormant stubs. We use ξS, ξI, and ξR to be the probabilities a stub is active and belongs to each
type of node, with 1 − π = ξ = ξS + ξI + ξR the probability a stub is active. The πS to ξS and ξS to πS
ﬂuxes are η1πS and η2ξS respectively. Similar results hold for the other compartments. We can use this to
show ˙ξ =−η2ξ + η1π =−η2ξ + η1(1− ξ) from which we can conclude that (at equilibrium) π = η2/(η1 + η2)
and ξ = η1/(η1 + η2). The ﬂuxes from ξI and πI to ξR and πR respectively represent recovery of the node
the stub belongs to and so are γξI and γπI respectively.
We can calculate ξS and πS explicitly. The probability a dormant stub belongs to a susceptible node
is πS = φDψ′(θ)/ψ′(1) where φD is the probability the dormant stub has never received infection, and
ψ′(θ)/ψ′(1) is the probability that none of the other stubs have received infection. Similarly, the probability

nodes (solid) with a Poisson maximum degree distribution of mean 3 compared with theory (dashed). Simulations are shifted
in time so that t = 0 corresponds to 3% cumulative incidence and then averaged. Because stochastic eﬀects are not negligible,
the individual peaks are not perfectly aligned, so the averaging has a small, but noticeable, eﬀect to reduce and broaden the
simulated peak. In larger populations this disappears.
The parameters are β = 2, γ = 1, η1 = γ, and η2 = γ/2. Simulations are again slow, so we use a smaller
population with 322 simulations, and average the 155 that became epidemics.
4 Expected Degree Models
We now consider SIR diseases spreading through “expected degree” networks. In these networks, each
individual has an expected degree κ, which need not be an integer. It is assigned using the probability
density function ρ(κ). Edges are placed between two nodes with probability proportional to the expected
degrees of the two nodes. In the actual degree models, once a stub belonging to u was joined into an
edge, it became unavailable for other edges: the existence of a u-v edge reduced the ability of u to form
other edges. In contrast for expected degree models, edges are assigned independently: a u-v edge does not
aﬀect whether u forms other edges. Similarly to before, a neighbor will tend to have larger expected degree
than a randomly chosen edge. The probability density function for a neighbor to have expected degree κ is
ρn(κ) = κρ(κ)/⟨K⟩.
Our approach remains similar. We consider a randomly chosen test node u which cannot infect its
neighbors, and calculate the probability u is susceptible. We ﬁrst consider the spread of disease through
static “Mixed Poisson” networks (also called Chung-Lu networks), for which an edge from u to v exists
with probability κuκv/(N− 1)⟨K⟩. We then consider the expected degree formulation of Mean Field Social
Heterogeneity. Following this, we consider the more general Dynamic Variable-Degree model, for which
a node creates and deletes edges as independent events, unlike the DFD model where deleted edges were
instantantly replaced. The Mixed Poisson model produces equations eﬀectively identical to the CM equations.
The Mean Field Social heterogeneity equations diﬀer somewhat from the actual degree version, but may be
shown [38] to be formally equivalent. The Dynamic Variable-Degree equations are simpler than the DFD
equations, and it may be more realistic because it does not enforce constant degree for an individual.
4.1 Mixed Poisson
We now consider the Mixed Poisson (MP) model. In this model, each node is assigned an expected degree κ
using the probability density function ρ(κ). A u-v edge exists with probability κuκv/(N− 1)⟨K⟩ indepen-
dently of other edges. We use the name “Mixed Poisson” because at karge N the actual degree of nodes with
expected degree κ is chosen from a Poisson distribution with mean κ. The degree distribution is a mixture
of Poisson distributions.

Consider two nodes u and v whose expected degrees are κu and κv = κu + ∆κ with ∆ κ≪ 1. Our
question is, how much does the additional ∆ κ reduce the probability v is susceptible? At leading order it
contributes an extra edge to v with probability ∆κ, and we may assume it contributes at most one additional
edge. We deﬁne Θ to be the probability an edge has not transmitted infection. With probability Θ∆ κ there
is an additional edge which has not transmitted. The probability the extra ∆ κ either does not contribute an
edge or contributes an edge which has not transmitted is 1 − ∆κ + Θ∆κ = 1− (1− Θ)∆κ. If s(κ, t) is the
probability a node of expected degree κ is susceptible, then we have s(κ + ∆κ, t) = s(κ, t)[1− (1− Θ)∆κ].
Taking ∆κ→ 0, this becomes ∂s/∂κ =−(1− Θ)s. Thus s(κ, t) = exp[−κ(1− Θ)] and S(t) = Ψ(Θ(t)) where
Ψ(x) =
∫ ∞
0
e−κ(1−x)ρ(κ) dκ
Note that this is the Laplace transform of ρ evaluated at 1− x. As before, ﬁgure 10 gives
˙R = γI , S = Ψ(Θ) , I = 1− S− R
and we need Θ( t).
We follow the CM approach almost exactly. The value of Θ is the probability an edge has not transmitted
to the test node u. We deﬁne Φ S, Φ I, and Φ R to be the probabilities an edge has not transmitted to u
and connects to either a susceptible, infected, or recovered node, so Θ = Φ S + ΦI + ΦR. To calculate
ΦS, we observe that a neighbor v of u with expected degree κ has the same probability of having an edge
to any w ̸= u as any other node of expected degree κ because edges are created independently of one
another. Thus given κ, v is susceptible with probability s(κ, t). Taking the weighted average over all κ gives
ΦS =
∫∞
0 ρn(κ)s(κ, t) dt =
∫∞
0 κ exp[−κ(1− Θ)]ρ(κ) dκ/⟨K⟩ = Ψ′(Θ)/Ψ′(1). The same techniques as for
the CM networks give Φ R = γ(1− Θ)/β. Our equations are
˙Θ =−βΘ + β Ψ′(Θ)
Ψ′(1) + γ(1− Θ) ,
˙R = γI , S = Ψ(Θ) , I = 1− S− R .
These equations are almost identical to those of CM epidemics except that Ψ and Θ replace ψ and θ . This
is not coincidence. In fact the MP networks are a special case of CM networks [38].

We take β = 0.15 and γ = 1, and perform simulations with a population of size 5 × 105 generated using the
algorithm of [36]. We compare simulation and prediction in ﬁgure 11.
4.2 Mean Field Social Heterogeneity
For the expected degree formulation of the Mean Field Social Heterogeneity (MFSH) model, the probability
an edge exists between u and v at time t is κuκv/(N− 1)⟨K⟩. Whether this edge exists at one moment is
independent of whether it exists at any other moment and what other edges exist.
As before, we consider two nodes whose expected degrees diﬀer by ∆ κ and ask how much the additional
∆κ reduces the probability of being susceptible. The deﬁnition of Θ is slightly more problematic here because
having an edge at one moment is independent of having one later. So it does not make sense to discuss the
probability an edge did not transmit previously because the edge did not exist previously. Instead, we note
that in the MP case (1 − Θ)∆κ could be interpreted as the probability that the additional amount of ∆ κ
ever contributed an edge that had transmitted infection. Guided by this, we deﬁne Θ so that as ∆ κ→ 0,

Figure 12: Mean Field Social Heterogeneity model. The ﬂow diagram for a Mean Field Social Heterogeneity population
(expected degree formulation). This is similar to the actual degree formulation in ﬁgure 4. The new variables Π S, Π I, and
ΠR (bottom right) represent the probability that a newly formed edge connects to a susceptible, infected, or recovered node,
they can be thought of as the relative rates that each group forms edges. Since the test node does not cause infections, and
the probability a contact is with a node of a given κ is equal to the probability a new contact will be with a node of the given
κ, the probability a current neighbor has a given state is equal to the probability a new neighbor has that state. Thus each Φ
variable equals the corresponding Π variable.
the extra amount of ∆ κ has at some time contributed an edge that transmitted to the node with pobability
(1− Θ)∆κ. This again leads to Ψ( x) =
∫∞
0 e−κ(1−x)ρ(κ) dκ. The ﬂow diagram for individuals (ﬁgure 12) is
unchanged:
˙R = γI , S = Ψ(Θ) , I = 1− S− R
To ﬁnd the evolution of Θ, we deﬁne Φ S, Φ I, and Φ R to be the probabilities a current edge connects
u to a susceptible, infected, or recovered node. The probability that a small extra amount ∆ κ currently
contributes an edge and previously had a diﬀerent edge that transmitted scales like ∆ κ2(1− Θ). Since
∆κ2≪ ∆κ, this is negligible compared to the probability that there is a current edge. We conclude that
at leading order, Φ S∆κ, Φ I∆κ, and Φ R∆κ give the probability that the ∆ κ contributes a current edge
connected to a susceptible, infected, or recovered node and there has never been a transmission due to this
extra ∆κ.
We can construct a ﬂow diagram between Φ S∆κ, Φ I∆κ, Φ R∆κ, and (1− Θ)∆κ. Because all of these
have ∆κ in them, we factor it out to create to just use Φ S, Φ I, Φ R, and 1 − Θ. Because edges have no
duration, there is no Φ S to ΦI or ΦI to ΦR ﬂux (similar to the actual degree MFSH model). Instead there
is ﬂux in and out of these compartments representing the continuing change of edges. The Φ I to 1− Θ ﬂux
is βΦI.
Because edges have no duration, the probability an edge connects to an individual of a given type is the
probability a new edge connects to an individual of that type: Φ S = ΠS, ΦI = ΠI, and Φ R = ΠI where ΠS,
ΠI and Π R are the probabilities that a newly formed edge connects to a susceptible, infected, or recovered
node.1 We have ΠS = Ψ′(Θ)/Ψ′(1) and ˙ΠR = γΠI. Since Π I = ΦI, this means ˙ΠR =−γ ˙Θ/β. Integrating
gives ΠR = γ(1− Θ)/β. So Π I = 1− Ψ′(Θ)/Ψ′(1)− γ(1− Θ)/β. Since ˙Θ =−βΦI =−βΠI, we ﬁnally have
˙Θ =−β + β Ψ′(Θ)
Ψ′(1) + γ(1− Θ)
˙R = γI , S = Ψ(Θ) , I = 1− S− R
Under appropriate limits the MFSH equations in k reduce to those in κ and vice versa, so the models are
equivalent [38]. Surprisingly, this system diﬀers from the MP equations only in the ﬁrst term of the ˙Θ
equation.
1Unlike the actual degree formulation we do not need a factor of Θ in these because the smallness of ∆ κ allows us to assume
there has never been a previous transmission.

Ψ(x) = e3x− 1
x(e3− 1)
We take γ = 1 and β = 0.435 and compare simulation with theory in ﬁgure 13. We choose these parameters
to demonstrate that the approach remains accurate for small R0 = 1.04. We use a population of 15 × 106.
There is noise since the epidemic does not infect a large number of people.
4.3 Dynamic Variable-Degree
The Dynamic Variable-Degree (DVD) model interpolates between the MP model and the expected degree
formulation of the MFSH model. Each node is assigned κ using ρ(κ) and creates edges at rate κη (joining
to another node also creating an edge). Existing edges break at rate η. Thus a node has expected degree κ,
though its value varies around κ. In fact it is Poisson distributed over time.
We deﬁne Θ such that the probability a small ∆ κ has ever contributed an edge that has transmitted
infection is (1− Θ)∆κ. We again have
˙R = γI , S = Ψ(Θ) , I = 1− S− R
We generalize the earlier deﬁnitions and deﬁne Φ S, Φ I, and Φ R to be the probabilities a current edge has
never transmitted infection and connects to a susceptible, infected, or recovered node.

We deﬁne Π S, Π I, and Π R to be the probabilities a new edge connects to a susceptible, infected, or
recovered node. We have ΠS = Ψ′(Θ)/Ψ′(1), Π I = 1−ΠS−ΠR, and ˙ΠR = γΠI. We build the ﬂow diagram
for ΦS∆κ, Φ I∆κ, Φ R∆κ, and (1− Θ)∆κ. There is ﬂux into Φ S∆κ at rate ηΠS∆κ because this is the rate
that the ∆ κ leads to edge creation. There is ﬂux out of Φ S∆κ at rate ηΦS∆κ because existing edges break
at rate η, and the probability such an edge exists is Φ S∆κ. Similar ﬂuxes exist for Φ I and ΦR. The ﬂux out
of ΦI∆κ into ΦR∆κ is γΦI∆κ as before, and the ﬂux into (1− Θ)∆κ is βΦI∆κ. We factor out ∆ κ and the
ﬂow diagrams (ﬁgure 14) are deﬁned.
Because the existence of an edge from the test node u to the neighbor v has no impact on any other edges
v might have, the contacts v has aside from u are indistinguishable from the contacts of another node with
the same κ, and so they are susceptible with the same probability: Φ S = ΠS. The ﬂuxes into and out of Φ S
from edge creation/deletion balance, and the Φ S to ΦI ﬂux is simply− ˙ΦS. Using this and the other ﬂuxes
for Φ I, we conclude ˙ΦI =− ˙ΦS + ηΠI− (η + γ + β)ΦI. Since ˙ΠR = γΠI and ˙Θ =−βΦI, we can integrate
this and ﬁnd Φ I =−Ψ′(Θ)/Ψ′(1) + ηΠR/γ + (β + η + γ)Θ/β− (η + γ)/β. So ˙Θ =−βΦI can be written in
terms of Θ and Π R. We arrive at

This is simpler than the DFD case because the smallness of ∆ κ allowed us to assume that no previous
transmission occurred.

simulated epidemics (solid) in a population of 10 4 nodes. For each simulation time is chosen so that t = 0 corresponds to 3%

We choose the same distribution of κ as of k in the DFD example, NB(4 , 1/3). We ﬁnd
Ψ(x) =
( 2
3− ex−1
)4
We take the same parameters β = 5/4, γ = 1, and η = 1/2. Figure 15 shows that the equations accurately
predict the spread. As in the DFD and DC case, we use an average as the comparison point, taking 240
simulations and averaging the 92 resulting in epidemics.
The ﬁnal size is larger than for the DFD model. Although the average numbers of contacts are all the
same, the increase in transmission routes when an individual had more contacts than expected outweighs
the decrease when the number was less than expected. The net eﬀect is to increase the ﬁnal size.
5 Discussion
We have introduced a new approach to study the spread of infectious diseases. This edge-based compart-
mental modeling approach allows us to simultaneously consider the impacts of contact duration and social
heterogeneity. It is conceptually simple and leads to equations of comparable simplicity to the mass action
model. It produces a broad family of models which contains several known models as special cases. It fur-
ther allows us to investigate the eﬀect of many behaviors which have previously been inaccessible to analytic
study.
A signiﬁcant contribution of this work is that it allows us to study the spread of a disease in a popu-
lation for which some individuals have diﬀerent propensity to form contacts while allowing us to explicitly
incorporate the impact of contact duration. The interaction of contact duration and numbers of overlapping
contacts plays a signiﬁcant role in the spread of many diseases, and in particular may play an important role
in the spread of HIV. These techniques open the door to studying these questions analytically rather than
relying on simulation.
The edge-based compartmental modeling approach has a simple, graphical interpretation through ﬂow
diagrams. This simpliﬁes model description, and guides generalizations. Because the derivations are straight-
forward, we need only track a small number of compartments, and we do not require any closure approxima-
tions, we propose that this is the “correct” perspective to study the deterministic dynamics of SIR epidemics
on random networks. Other existing techniques rely on approximations [14] or produce complicated or large
systems of equations [53, 27, 5]. This approach does not oﬀer immediate insight into stochastic eﬀects where
methods such as branching processes are more appropriate. In later papers, we use this approach to derive
18
===== PAGE 19 =====
other generalizations, including diﬀerent correlations in population structure, diﬀerent disease dynamics, and
populations that change structure in response to the spreading disease.
Our approach is limited by the assumption that infection of one neighbor of u can be treated as inde-
pendent of that of another neighbor. This is a strong assumption, and prevents us from applying this model
to SIS diseases for which individuals return to a susceptible state. In this case, the assumption that u does
not infect its neighbors can alter the future state of u. In the real population, if u becomes infected, it
can infect neighbors who then infect u when u returns to a susceptible state. Thus if contact duration is
nonzero, our predictions may be signiﬁcantly altered. This limitation is often not recognized but may lead
to important failures of mean-ﬁeld or mass action models when applied to a population for which contact
duration is important [7].
Treating neighbors as independent also means that if v and w are neighbors of u, we assume no alternate
short path between v and w exists. In particular, we assume that clustering [57, 43] is negligible: neighbors
are unlikely to see one another. This assumption applies equally to most existing analytic epidemic models,
but it can be eliminated in special cases using techniques similar to those of [55, 33, 44, 21].

A Appendix
In this appendix, we give additional information for the edge-based compartmental modeling approach for
the spread of susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) diseases in diﬀerent types of static and dynamic networks.
We give a more detailed discussion of the use of a test node and the assumption that test nodes do not
cause infections. We then discuss the calculation ofR0, the behavior of our equations at early time (showing
that the thresholds they predict are the same as those given by R0), and for some cases we give the ﬁnal
size prediction. Finally, we show that the MFSH models we have used are in fact equivalent to some more
familiar existing models.
B Selection of the test node
The basis of our approach is the claim that the probability a randomly selected test node u is susceptible,
infected, or recovered is equal to the proportion of the population that is susceptible, infected, or recovered.
This claim implicitly assumes that the epidemic size grows deterministically: if stochastic eﬀects could cause
the outbreak to die out or even be slightly delayed, this claim is false. The probability a random node u is
infected by time t depends on whether an epidemic happens and, if so, how delayed it is. So as in any ODE
approach, our model is exact only once the outbreak is large enough to behave deterministically.
Our assumptions that the susceptible proportion of the population equals the probability u is suscep-
tible, the proportion infected equals the probability u is infected, and the proportion recovered equals the
probability u is recovered allow us to move our focus away from the proportion in each state. Instead we
focus on the probability that u is in each state. Our goal remains to determine the course of the epidemic in
19
===== PAGE 20 =====
the entire population, but our method will be to focus on the equivalent problem of ﬁnding the probability
the randomly chosen test node u has a given status.
In order to calculate the probability thatu is susceptible, infected, or recovered, we ﬁnd another equivalent
problem which is mathematically simpler. We make a simplifying assumption which allows us to treat
neighbors of u as independent. As it stands, if w infects u, then u can infect another neighbor v, meaning
the satus of v and w are not independent. We ignore this dependency, that is, we ignore transmissions from
u to its neighbors. To make this mathematically precise, we prevent u from transmitting infection to its
neighbors. This has no impact until after u is infected, so it has no impact on the probability u is susceptible.
It may aﬀect the state of neighbors of u once u is infected, but it has no impact on the duration of infection
of u, and so it does not alter the probability that u is infected or recovered. Consequently, this alteration
of u has no impact on the probability that u is in any given state. Thus our result for S, I, and R is not
aﬀected by preventing u from causing infection.
Consequently, we can calculate S, I, and R as the probability that u is susceptible, infected, or recovered
under the assumption that u is prevented from causing infection. The result will give the proportion of the
population that is susceptible, infected or recovered in the original epidemic.
C Simulation
Both static networks and networks with mean ﬁeld social heterogeneity satisfy the “time homogeneity”
assumption of [23]. That is, given the properties of u and v, the a priori probability that u would transmit
infection to v if u is infected is independent of the time at which u becomes infected. Consequently, for these
cases we can use the Epidemic Percolation Network (EPN) approach of [22]. In this, we consider each node
u in turn. We assume that u becomes infected and select the duration of infection from the appropriate
exponential distribution of mean γ. Given the duration of infection, for every node v that u might infect, we
calculate the probability that u infects v, and randomly determine whether u infects v, and if so, how long
it takes. We then create a directed network by assigning edges from u to each node it would infect with the
edge weighted by the associated duration. This directed network is an EPN.
To simulate an epidemic, we can choose a node to be the index case. We then follow the epidemic as it
passes from each node to the nodes that it would infect. If the outbreak remains small, we discard it. This
can be done eﬃciently using Dijkstra’s algorithm [13]. To quickly identify a node which sparks an epidemic,
we can take the EPN and ﬁnd the strongly-connected components within it. Above the epidemic threshold
there is a single giant strongly-connected component. Any node from its “in-component” (including any
node within the giant strongly-connected component) would spark an epidemic. We choose any of these
nodes randomly and use it as the index case.
The DVD, DFD, and DC models are harder to frame in terms of the EPN framework, so we use more
traditional simulation techniques. We use a Gillespie-style event-driven algorithm [18] and calculate whether
the next event is a transmission, recovery, edge creation or edge breaking. For the DFD model, edges break
in pairs and neighbors are swapped. These calculations are considerably slower because there are many
events to track, only a few of which are directly relevant to disease transmission.
D R0, early growth, and ﬁnal size
In this section, we brieﬂy turn away from the deterministic ODE methods and use branching process argu-
ments to calculateR0 for each population. We then return to the ODEs and linearize the equations about
the equilibrium corresponding to a fully susceptible population. We calculate the early growth rate, show
that it is consistent with the branching processR0 above, and identify appropriate initial conditions. Finally,
for most of the models, we are able to calculate a ﬁnal size relation.
The typically quoted deﬁnition of R0 is the number of new cases caused by a single randomly infected
individual in a completely susceptible population. However, a more careful deﬁnition is necessary in cases
where the average individual in the population may have diﬀerent properties than the average infected
20
===== PAGE 21 =====
individual early in the epidemic. The appropriate deﬁnition of R0 is the number of new cases an average
infected individual causes early in an outbreak [11, 51, 34, 52]. In particular, for an epidemic on a network,
a single node chosen randomly in the population and then infected will have (on average) ⟨K⟩ neighbors
to infect, while early on the typical infected node has higher degree than a randomly chosen node and has
at least one neighbor which is no longer susceptible. Early in an outbreak, the probability mass function
for a newly infected node in the actual degree case to have degree k is Pn(k) = kP (k)/⟨K⟩, while in the
expected degree case the probability density function for a newly infected node to have expected degree κ
is ρn(κ) = κρ(κ)/⟨K⟩. Consequently, we must account for the fact that such a node has higher degree than
average, but we must also account for the fact that such a node cannot infect the source of its infection.
In our calculation of the early growth, we (as expected) ﬁnd that if R0 < 1, the disease has negative
growth rate. We assume that the early growth is proportional to the leading eigenvector and use this
to ﬁnd appropriate initial conditions. In practice this is unnecessary because eﬀectively any appropriate
initial condition (with almost all individuals and stubs being in a susceptible state) quickly converges to the
leading eigenvector. For our calculation of the ﬁnal size, we are often able to identify a unique equilibrium
corresponding to the state of the population after the disease has spread through. For some models this
is not possible. As expected, if R0 < 1, we ﬁnd that the only equilibrium corresponds to no large scale
transmission, but ifR0 > 1 there is an additional equilibrium which we can calculate to ﬁnd the ﬁnal size.
Most of our calculations for the early growth and ﬁnal size are done under the assumption that an epidemic
occurs and in the limit that the initial proportion infected goes to zero. Thus our results are inappropriate
forR0 < 1. In calculating φS and φR in terms of θ, we found that they take particular forms. However,
the imposed initial conditions could be diﬀerent. In the growing epidemic case, these early perturbations
become insigniﬁcant as the number of infections becomes much larger than the initial conditions. However,
in the case of a decaying epidemic, the initial number of infections is always signiﬁcant compared to the
later number. So the variations never disappear. Thus if the initial conditions do not satisfy the formulae
we derived, the later solution does not either. This can still be handled using the edge-based compartmental
modeling approach. To correct for this in the CM model (and similar models) we would need to ﬁnd the
equation for ˙φS and ˙φI (resulting in a system more like the DFD equations).
D.1 Actual degree models
D.1.1 CM
R0 In a CM network the expected number of infections a newly infected node causes isR0 = ∑
k Pn(k)(k−
1)β/(β + γ) where β/(β + γ) is the probability a node infects a neighbor prior to recovering. The reason for
the k− 1 is that a newly infected node has one neighbor (its infector) who is not susceptible, and so there
are k− 1 susceptible neighbors. So
R0 =

which is a well-known result for static CM networks. This calculation is in agreement with previous results
for CM networks [32, 42, 2, 3, 51].
In the special case of a network with a Poisson degree distribution, the probability of selecting a higher
degree node and the reduction by one in the available number of susceptible neighbors exactly balance. So

21
===== PAGE 22 =====
Early Growth and Initial Conditions We return to the deterministic equations
˙θ =−βθ + β ψ′(θ)
ψ′(1) + γ(1− θ) ,
˙R = γI , S = ψ(θ) , I = 1− S− R .
Clearly θ = 1 is an equilibrium solution corresponding to no transmission. To test its stability, we linearize
about θ = 1. We set θ = 1 + ϵ. At leading order we ﬁnd
˙ϵ =
(
−β + β ψ′′(1)
ψ′(1)− γ
)
ϵ
So at early times ϵ = Ce λt where
λ = β ψ′′(1)
ψ′(1)− (β + γ)
The equilibrium loses stability asλ transitions from negative to positive,βψ′′(1)/ψ′(1)(β+γ), which is exactly
the condition forR0 to transition from below 1 to above 1. Both methods predict the same threshold.
To ﬁnd appropriate initial conditions for S, I, and R, we could simply take S = ψ(θ), and choose
any nonnegative I and R such that 1 = S + I + R. As we solve forward, any error in I and R decays
exponentially quickly. If we wish to be more precise, we note that ˙I =− ˙S− γI, and at leading order
˙S = ˙θψ′(θ) = λCe λtψ′(1) to leading order. We will have I = Ke λt, and we need to ﬁnd K in terms of C.
We get λKe λt =−Cλψ′(1)eλt− γKe λt. Solving this gives K =−Cλψ′(1)/(γ + λ), so the appropriate initial
condition is
θ(0) = 1 + C, S (0) = ψ(θ(0)), I (0) =− Cλψ′(1)
γ + λ , R (0) = 1− I(0)− S(0)
where C is a small, negative number.
However, in practice, there is no need to do this. I and R have no role to play in determining θ. We
simply require that I + R = 1− ψ(θ) initially. Although our initial distribution of probability to I and R
may diﬀer from the true amount, it is a small eﬀect initially and decays exponentially. So in practice we can
use any convenient assumption.
Final Size To calculate the ﬁnal size, we note that as the epidemic dies out, the derivatives must all go
to zero. Thus we can set ˙θ = 0 and solve for θ(∞). Note that (if R0 > 1) this has two solutions, as there
are two equilibrium conditions. In one equilibrium the disease has not been introduced and θ = 1, while
in the other the disease has spread and died out and θ < 1. We want the smaller of the solutions, which
corresponds to an epidemic occuring. We solve
θ(∞) = γ
β + γ + β
β + γ
ψ′(θ(∞))
ψ′(1)
for the smaller solution. In practice, this can be done by using a guess θ1 = 0, and then plugging θi into
the right hand side to ﬁnd θi+1. This iteration converges quickly, and if R0 > 1, the attracting solution
is the solution we want. The total fraction of the population infected in the course of an epidemic is
R(∞) = 1− ψ(θ(∞)).
D.1.2 Actual Degree MFSH
R0 To ﬁndR0 for the actual degree formulation of the MFSH model, we consider a newly infected node
early in the epidemic. The probability it has degree k is Pn(k). Because it has a new set of neighbors at
each moment, we do not have to account for the fact that it cannot infect the source of its infection, nor do
we have to account for the fact that once it infects a neighbor, it cannot infect the neighbor again. Thus
22
===== PAGE 23 =====
at all times it has k susceptible neighbors, so it causes new infections at rate βk for the entire time it is
infected. The average duration of infection is 1 /γ, so the expected number of infections caused given k is
βk/γ . Averaging over k, we have

Early Growth and Initial Conditions We begin with the equations
˙θ =−βθ + β θ2ψ′(θ)
ψ′(1) − θγ ln θ
˙R = γI , S = ψ(θ) , I = 1− S− R
we proceed similarly to the CM case. We set θ = 1 + ϵ and at leading order we ﬁnd
˙ϵ =
(
−β + β 2ψ′(1) + ψ′′(1)
ψ′(1) − γ
)
ϵ
After some rearrangement, we have ˙ϵ = [β− γ + βψ′′(1)/ψ′(1)]ϵ. So ϵ = Ce λt where
λ = β ψ′′(1)
ψ′(1) + β− γ
The equilibrium loses stability exactly where R0 = 1. The remaining calculations are identical to those of
the CM case, and we ﬁnd that the appropriate initial conditions are as before except that the value of λ is
diﬀerent
θ(0) = 1 + C, S (0) = ψ(θ(0)), I (0) =− Cλψ′(1)
γ + λ , R (0) = 1− I(0)− S(0)
(recall C is a small, negative number). As before, any reasonable initial condition with θ close to 1, S = ψ(θ)
and I + R = 1− S would be acceptable.
Final Size To ﬁnd the ﬁnal size of an epidemic, we set ˙θ to zero and solve for θ. We ﬁnd
θ(∞) = exp
[
− β
γ
(
1− θ(∞)ψ′(θ(∞))
ψ′(1)
)]
IfR0 > 1 this has two solutions, one with θ = 1, and one with 0 < θ < 1, which is the solution of interest.
Once this is found, the total fraction infected is R(∞) = 1− ψ(θ(∞)).
Note that if ψ(x) = xk for some k, this corresponds to the MFSH model with all individuals having the
contact rate kβ, which is the MA model and R0 = kβ/γ . We ﬁnd
θ = exp
(
− β
γ [1− θk]
)
23
===== PAGE 24 =====
Rewriting the left hand side as θ = S1/k = (1− R(∞))1/k and raising both sides to the k’th power, we have
1− R(∞) = exp
(
− kβ
γ R(∞)
)
Which is the well known ﬁnal size relation for the MA model
R(∞) = 1− exp(−R0R(∞))
D.1.3 DFD
R0 To calculateR0 for this model, consider a randomly chosen newly infected node early in the epidemic.
It has degree k with probability Pn(k). Initially this node has k− 1 available susceptible neighbors. Let us
focus instead on the one edge from the infection source. The stub may result in more infections if the edge
is broken and reformed. The probability that it breaks and reforms prior to recovering is η/(η + γ). The
probability that it then causes infection prior to recovering is β/(β + γ). At this point the stub is connected
to an infected neighbor, the same state it was at the beginning of infection and the process repeats. So
the probability this stub infects at least n nodes is rn where r = ηβ/[(β + γ)(η + γ)]. Summing this gives
an expectation of r/(1− r) new infections for this stub. Now consider one of the k− 1 stubs that are not
the source of infection. The probability that this stub transmits infection at least once is β/(β + γ). After
this it is like the stub that received infection. Thus the expected number of infections such a stub causes is
[β/(β + γ)][1 + r/(1− r)] which can be rearranged into [( η + γ)/η][r/(1− r)].
Adding these together, we see that a newly infected node is expected to cause

Here we have a higher dimensional problem, and the equilibrium of interest is θ = 1, φS = 1, φI = 0,
πS = 1, and πI = 0. We set θ = 1 + ϵ1, φS = 1 + ϵ2, and φI = ϵ3. For πS we use πS = θψ′(θ)/ψ′(1). For
πI, we set πI = ϵ4 and use the fact that ˙πI =− ˙πS− γπI. We linearize about the equlibrium. We ﬁnd

The standard solution technique for this is to ﬁnd the largest eigenvalue of the matrix. It is relatively
straightforward to show that 0 and −η are always eigenvalues of this matrix. The other two turn out to be
the eigenvalues of the 2× 2 matrix forming the lower right corner. They are

For our above expression, if R0 = 1, then ψ′′(1)/ψ′(1) = ( γ− η)/(γ + η) + γ/β. Placing this into our
expression above, the largest eigenvalue becomes 0. If ψ′′(1)/ψ′(1) is larger than this threshold ( R0 > 1)
then an epidemic can occur. If it is less than this threshold, this eigenvalue goes below zero, but there is still
an eigenvector of zero whose eigenvector has ϵ3 and ϵ4 both zero (corresponding to φI and πI both zero).
IfR0 is less than 1, the values of ϵ3 and ϵ4 will decay according to the largest eigenvalue whose eigenvector
has nonzero entries in the appropriate component.
For initial conditions, if R0 > 1, we take λ to be the largest eigenvalue, and the vector ( a, b, c, d) to
be the corresponding eigenvalue. Then the appropriate initial conditions are found by taking θ = 1 + ϵa,
φS = 1 + ϵb, φI = ϵc, and πI = ϵd where ϵ≪ 1. Note that we must choose our eigenvector such that a < 0.
In practice however, so long as the initial amount of infection is taken to be very small, the initial conditions
need not take this exact form; the solution will quickly converge to something of this form. If R0 < 1, then
the appropriate initial conditions come from a linear combination of the eigenvector of 0 and the decaying
eigenvector. The coeﬃcient of the 0-eigenvector will be very small unless the initial introduction infected
many individuals.
We note that in the previous cases, if R0 < 1, then the pertubation to θ decays, and θ returns to 1.
Physically, this is an unrealistic result: it says that if transmission has already happened, then as time
progresses, transmission is undone. Here we do not see that. If transmission has happened, then it does
not decay, corresponding to the eigenvector of 0. The reason that this model is more correct, is that in the
previous models, we found a relation between φI and θ. This relation implicitly assumes that the epidemic
is growing. If it is not growing, then this relation does not hold. Eliminating the assumption from those
models would result in additional equations for φS and φI, and the system would look more like the DFD
model.
Final Size We have not been able to ﬁnd a simple expression for the ﬁnal size of an epidemic in this case.
The system has multiple equilibria corresponding to possible states after the disease was introduced. In
25
===== PAGE 26 =====
the previous cases, we were able to ﬁnd a closed form for the relation between θ and φI. The assumption
made there was equivalent to stating that the early growth is dominated by the largest eigenvector. In the
previous cases, this assumption led to an analytic relation between φI and θ. In our case, we still want
to make the equivalent assumption, which gives a constraint that determines which equilibrium is the ﬁnal
state. However, we have not found a way to impose the constraint analytically. Instead we must solve the
system using initial conditions corresponding to a small number of cases to ﬁnd the correct ﬁnal size. Thus
we only have the ﬁnal size as a numerical prediction.
D.1.4 DC
To calculateR0 for the DC model, we ﬁrst deﬁne ra, rd, and rs to be the expected number of infections
caused by a stub prior to recovery given that the stub is active and connected to a node other than the
source, dormant, or active but connected to the source of infection at the time of infection.
It is straightforward to show that if the stub is active and connected to a node other than the source, the
probability that the edge transmits prior to breaking or recovery is β/(β + γ + η2). The probability it breaks
prior to recovery is η2/(γ + η2). Once it breaks, it is equivalent to a stub that was dormant at infection.
Thus ra = β/(β + γ + η2) + η2rd/(γ + η2).
To ﬁnd rd, we note that a dormant stub must ﬁnd a neighbor prior to recovery before it can cause
any transmissions. Once this happens, it is equivalent to a stub that was active at infection. Thus rd =
η1ra/(γ + η1). Combining this with our expression for ra, we have
ra = β(η1 + γ)(η2 + γ)
γ(γ + η1 + η2)(β + γ + η2) .
To ﬁnd rs, we note that infection cannot happen along that stub until the stub breaks and reforms at
which point it is equivalent to an active stub, so rs = η1η2ra/[(γ + η1)(γ + η2)].
The probability that a stub is active is ξ = η1/(η1 + η2) and the probability it is dormant is π = 1− ξ.
The total number of infections a node with degree km is expected to cause is rs +( k−1)ξra +( k−1)(1− ξ)rd.
Since the probability a newly infected node has degree km is Pn(km) = kmP (km)/⟨Km⟩, we ﬁnd

Early Growth and Initial Conditions We have not attempted to calculate the early growth rate because
showing the details will not be particularly informative. The method is similar to that for the DFD model.
If we wish to use appropriate initial conditions, we simply begin with θ approximately 1, φS approximately
26
===== PAGE 27 =====
π, φD approximately θ− φS, πS approximately π, and ξS approximately ξ. We can make all the R variables
0, and then set the I variables to I = 1− S, φI = θ− φS− φD, πI = π− πS, and ξI = ξ− ξS. This will
converge relatively quickly to the appropriate eigenvalue. Alternately, we could solve the linear system and
identify the appropriate eigenvalue and use it to ﬁnd the initial conditions.
Final Size As in the DFD case, we need an additional constraint to identify the appropriate equilibrium.
We do not have this constraint analytically, so we must solve the ODE system numerically to ﬁnd the ﬁnal
size.
D.2 Expected Degree Models
D.2.1 MP
R0 We calculateR0 much as in the CM network. We focus on all individuals with a given expected degree
κ: these nodes have a Poisson degree distribution, and the fact that those with higher degree are more
likely to become infected exactly cancels the reduction in available contacts, and so the expected number
of remaining contacts of a newly infected node with expected degree κ is κ. So the expected number of
infections such a node causes is κβ/(γ + β). To ﬁndR0, we must take a weighted average over the value of
κ for newly infected individuals.
The probability a newly infected individual has expected degree κ is ρn(κ). So we ﬁnd
R0 =
∫ ∞

ρn(κ) κβ

, so this result is the same as the
CM result.
Early Growth and Initial Conditions To calculate the early growth, we take
˙Θ =−βΘ + β Ψ′(Θ)
Ψ′(1) + γ(1− Θ) ,
˙R = γI , S = Ψ(Θ) , I = 1− S− R .
and set Θ = 1 + ϵ. At leading order we have
˙ϵ =
(
−β + β Ψ′′(1)
Ψ′(1)− γ
)
ϵ
We ﬁnd ϵ = Ce λt where
λ = β Ψ′′(1)
Ψ′(1)− (β + γ)
Looking at the threshold, we see that λ = 0 exactly whereR0 = 1.
To ﬁnd appropriate initial conditions, we follow the CM case and ﬁnd
Θ(0) = 1 + C, S (0) = Ψ(Θ(0)), I (0) =− CλΨ′(1)
γ + λ , R (0) = 1− I(0)− S(0)
where C is a small, negative number.

Final Size The ﬁnal size of epidemics in MP networks can be calculated in much the same way as for CM
networks. We set ˙Θ = 0 and ﬁnd
Θ(∞) = γ
β + γ + β
β + γ
Ψ′(Θ(∞))
Ψ′(1)
Then S(∞) = Ψ(Θ(∞)) and R(∞) = 1− S(∞).
D.2.2 Expected Degree MFSH
R0 To ﬁndR0 for the actual degree formulation of the MFSH model, we consider a newly infected node
early in the epidemic. The probability density function for the expected degree κ is ρn(κ). Because it has a
new set of neighbors at each moment, we do not have to account for the fact that it cannot infect the source
of its infection, nor do we have to account for the fact that once it infects a neighbor, it cannot infect the
neighbor again. Thus on average it has κ susceptible neighbors, so it causes new infections at average rate
βκ for the entire time it is infected. The average duration of infection is 1 /γ, so the expected number of
infections caused given k is βκ/γ. Taking the average over all κ, we have
R0 =

Early Growth and Initial Conditions Our governing equations are
˙Θ =−β + β Ψ′(Θ)
Ψ′(1) + γ(1− Θ)
˙R = γI , S = Ψ(Θ) , I = 1− S− R
Setting Θ = 1 + ϵ, we have
˙ϵ =
(
β Ψ′′(1)
Ψ′(1)− γ
)
ϵ
So ϵ = Ce λt where
λ = β Ψ′′(1)
Ψ′(1)− γ
We see that the threshold for λ = 0 is again the same as R0 = 1.
To ﬁnd the initial conditions, we repeat our previous approach and ﬁnd
Θ(0) = 1 + C, S (0) = Ψ(Θ(0)), I (0) =− CλΨ′(1)
γ + λ , R (0) = 1− I(0)− S(0)
where C is a small, negative number.
Final Size To ﬁnd the ﬁnal size we set ˙Θ = 0 and ﬁnd that Θ(∞) solves
Θ = β
γ
(
1 + Ψ′(Θ)

)

Then we have R(∞) = 1− Ψ(Θ(∞)).

D.2.3 DVD
To calculateR0 for the DVD population, we begin by considering a newly infected node soon after disease is
introduced. Because nodes are infected with probability proportional to their expected degree, the probability
density function for a node to have expected degree κ given that it is newly infected is ρn(κ) = κρ(κ)/⟨K⟩.
Given a newly infected node with expected degree κ, the expected number of additional neighbors (other
than its infector) it has is also κ (as in the static MP case). For each of those neighbors, the probability that
it transmits infection prior to recovering or breaking the edge is β/(β + η + γ). So the expected number of
transmissions to neighbors it has when the infection occurs is κρ(κ)β/[⟨K⟩ (β + η + γ)].
However, the node also has the opportunity to infect neighbors that it gains during its infectious period.
The probability that it creates a new edge before recovering is given by considering the recovery rate γ, and
the edge creation rate κη. We track edge creations before recovery. The probability that at least one edge
creation occurs κη/(γ + κη). More generally, the probability that at least n edge creations is [κη/(γ + κη)]n.
If it gains at least n neighbors, the probability that it infects the n-th neighbor before recovering or breaking
the edge is β/(β + η + γ). So the probability that a node creates an n-th neighbor and infects that neighbor
is [β/(β + η + γ)][(κη)/(γ + κ + η)]n
The expected number of newly created neighbors which it infects can be found by summing the probability
that a node creates and infects an n-th neighbor over all n. This gives [ β/(β + η + γ)] ∑
n[κη/(γ + κη)]n =
[β/(β + η + γ)][κη/γ]. Adding the expected number of new and original neighbors infected together, the
expected number of infections a node with κ causes is [β/(β + η + γ)]κ[1 + η/γ]. Taking a weighted average
over all κ gives
R0 =

for a newly infected node, β/(β + η + γ) gives the probability that an edge which exists at any point

(η + γ)/γ = 1 + [ η/γ] gives the expected number of susceptible contacts per expected degree to exist at
infection (1) or be created prior to recovery ( η/γ).
Early growth We take the equations

˙ΠR = γΠI , ΠS = Ψ′(Θ)/Ψ′(1) , ΠI = 1− ΠS− ΠR ,
˙R = γI , S = Ψ(Θ) , I = 1− S− R .
We set Θ = 1 + ϵ1 and ΠR = ϵ2. We note that ˙ΠR = γΠI = γ(1− ΠS− ΠR). At leading order we have
˙ϵ1 =−βϵ1 + β Ψ′′(1)

The eigenvalues of a 2 × 2 matrix solve λ2− T λ + D where T is the trace and D the determinant. So the
dominant eigenvalue is
λ = T +
√
T 2− 4D
2
If T > 0, then the growth rate is positive. To show that T > 0 implies R0 > 1, note that T > 0 implies
βψ′′(1)/ψ′(1) > β + γ + η. From this the product of the ﬁrst two factors in our expression for R0 is greater
than 1. Because ( η + γ)/γ > 1, it follows that R0 > 1. If T≤ 0, then our equations predict growth if and
only if D < 0. To complete our argument that the equations predict growth exactly when R0 > 1, we must
show that if T≤ 0, thenR0 > 1 is equivalent to D < 0. We can show that
D =−β(η + γ)Ψ′′(1)
Ψ′(1) + γ(β + γ + η)
From this a small amount of algebra shows D < 0 is equivalent toR0 > 1. Thus regardless of the sign of T ,
λ > 0 exactly whenR0 > 1, and conversely λ < 0 exactly whenR0 < 1. So the predicted thresholds are the
same.
To ﬁnd the appropriate initial conditions, we can again take any suﬃciently small reasonable initial
condition and the particulars of the initial condition will be unimportant. Alternately, we can note that the
solution for ( ϵ1, ϵ2) must converge to Ce λtv where v is the eigenvector of the eigenvalue λ. This takes the
value
v =
(
λ + γ
γ Ψ′′(1)
Ψ′(1)
)
From this it is straightforward to ﬁnd the appropriate initial conditions using the approaches seen before.
Final Size At the end of the epidemic, no infected nodes remain, and so I(∞) = Φ I(∞) = Π I(∞) = 0.
We have ΠR(∞) = 1− ΠS(∞) = 1− Ψ′(Θ(∞))/Ψ′(1). Setting ˙Θ = 0 we ﬁnd
Θ(∞) = β
β + η + γ
(η + γ

Ψ′(Θ(∞))
Ψ′(1) + η + γ

We can solve this for Θ(∞) using iterative methods. The total fraction infected is
R = 1− S = 1− Ψ(Θ(∞))
E Equivalence of MFSH models with pre-existing models
The basic equations for the MFSH model used by other authors [1, 29, 30, 40, 48] are
˙Sk =−βkS kζ
˙Ik = βkS kζ− γIk
ζ =
∑
k kP (k)Ik
⟨K⟩
However, in the actual degree case we have derived
˙θ =−βθ + β θ2ψ′(θ)
ψ′(1) − θγ ln θ (28)
˙R = γI , S = ψ(θ) , I = 1− S− R (29)
It is not immediately obvious that these are equivalent. To see that they are, we ﬁrst reduce the dimensions
of the ﬁrst system. We note that the equation for ˙Sk has as solution
Sk = e−βk
∫ t
−∞ ζ(t′) dt′
30
===== PAGE 31 =====
We set α = e−β
∫ t
−∞ ζ(t′) dt′
and then Sk = αk. Our goal is to show that in fact, α solves the same equation
as θ. We begin by noting that
˙α =−βζα
So ζ =− ˙α/βα
We now move to ﬁnding ˙ζ.
˙ζ =
∑
k kP (k) ˙Ik
⟨K⟩
=
∑
k kP (k)[βkS kζ− γIk]
ψ′(1)
= βζ
∑
k k2P (k)αkζ
ψ′(1) −
∑
k kP (k)γIk
ψ′(1)

∑
k(k2− k + k)P (k)αkζ
ψ′(1) − γζ
= βζ ψ′′(α)α2 + ψ′(α)α
ψ′(1) − γζ
= αβζ ψ′′(α)α + ψ′(α)
ψ′(1) − γζ
= αβζ
d
dα(αψ′(α))
ψ′(1) − γζ
We substitute ζ =− ˙α/βα to express this as a derivative.
˙ζ =− ˙α

dα(αψ′(α))
ψ′(1) + γ
β
˙α
α
= d
dt
[
− αψ′(α)
ψ′(1) + γ
β ln α
]
We can integrate this to ﬁnd
ζ = 1− αψ′(α)
ψ′(1) + γ
β ln α
(using the fact that ζ→ 0 and α→ 1 at early time) and so ˙α =−βαζ becomes
˙α =−βα + βα2 ψ′(α)
ψ′(1)− αγ ln α
which means that α solves the same equation as θ for the ﬁxed degree version of the MFSH equations. Since
Sk = αk is the same formula as we would ﬁnd for Sk in terms of θ, this shows that in fact the two systems
of equations are equivalent.
We are not the ﬁrst to see that the usual system can be simpliﬁed into a handful of equations, but the
approach we have used to derive these equations is new. Previous authors have simply observed that the Sk
equation can be solved, done so, and then used a change of variables. The resulting equations are equivalent
to our own, but are written in terms of slightly diﬀerent variables. The advantage of our system is that the
variables connect more easily to meaningful quantities, so it can be derived directly, and it can be related to
the other edge-based compartmental models.
The usual model can be altered to allow for continuous contact rates, which would yield
˙Sκ =−βκSκζ
˙Iκ = βκSκζ− γIκ
ζ =
∫∞
0 κρ(κ)Iκ dκ
⟨K⟩
31

A similar approach shows that this is equivalent to our expected degree formulation of the MFSH equations.
